Notes, code and examples created for learning Scala

The structure of the notes, learning objectives and practice exercises will be laid out along the lines defined by [Scala levels](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610).

**Level A1: Beginning application programmer**

1. Java-like statements and expressions: standard operators, method calls, conditionals, loops, try/catch
2. class, object, def, val, var, import, package
3. Infix notation for method calls
4. Simple closures
5. Collections with map, filter, etc
6. for-expressions
