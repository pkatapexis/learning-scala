What is Scala?	Scala is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language that blends imperative and functional programming styles.
What is an Imperative programming style?	Imperative programs focus on how a program operates. It describes computation in terms of statements that change a programs state.
What is a Functional programming style?	A Functional programming style treats computations as the evaluations of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.

What does defining a variable as a val mean?	"That the variable will be assigned once and never change<div><br /></div><div>val forEver = ""Can never change""</div>"
What does defining a variable as var mean?	"That the variables value may be reassigned<div><br /></div><div>var changeable = ""First this""</div><div>changeable = ""Now this""</div>"
What is type inference?	Where the Scala interpreter infers the variables type to be the type of its initialization assignment.
How would you explicitly specify the type of a variable as a String?	"val msg: java.lang.String = ""A String""<div><br /></div><div>or&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>val msg: String = ""A String""</div>"

What must you do if you want to use more than one statement in the body of a method?	Enclose them inside curly braces

How are command line arguments accessed in Scala scripts?	"Via a Scala array named args<div><br /></div><div>i.e. println(""Hello, "" + args(0) + ""!"")</div>"
How are Scala array elements accessed?	By specifying the array elements index in parentheses<div><br /></div><div>i.e. names(5)</div>

How do you check values of class parameters?	Any code in the class definition which isn't part of a method definition is compiled into the body of the primary constructor.
What are auxiliary constructors?	Methods named 'this' that allow construction of a class with overloaded parameter lists
What is a singleton object?	An object that can't be instantiated and which there is ever only one instance.
What is a companion object?	An object that shares the same name with a class.
What is a stand-alone object?	An object for which there is no class with the same name.
